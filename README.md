# Random Buy Amount Mini Project

This project is a fun, experimental tool designed to automate the purchase of cryptocurrencies from Binance based on predefined risk categories: conservative, mid-risk, and high-risk. It randomly selects a set of coins from these categories and executes buy orders for a total specified amount, distributing the purchase evenly across the selected coins.

## Features

- Automatically selects cryptocurrencies from predefined risk categories.
- Distributes a total specified purchase amount across selected cryptocurrencies.
- Executes buy orders on the Binance platform at market prices.
